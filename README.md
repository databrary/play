# Databrary 

Want to help out? Please reach out via email, commenting on an issue, or whatever works for you. We have significant experience mentoring new developers and Haskell developers.

We have [preliminary library
documentation](http://databrary.github.io/databrary/) on our GitHub Pages site.
Haddocks coverage would be another excellent place to start contributing...

A simple [code coverage report](http://databrary.github.io/databrary/) is also
available on our GitHub pages site.

## Why?

Accelerate the pace of sharing and reusing recorded, annotated video, to increase the pace of analysis and discovery in behaviorial science. Sharing restricted videos without burdening researchers heavily requires a sophisticated, yet simple, approach to entering release level information and authorizing networks of users to datasets. It also requires convenient mechanisms for uploading large collections of video files. It requires allowing for a very flexible model of meta-data to allow a large variety of attributes to be attached to a given dataset.
